Create a program that matches a student and his/her unique ID with the courses he/she is taking. You should consider transferred students who do not have an ID for a while, they acquire it later. Also, consider that a student attends multiple courses.
Finally, it should be printed:
(a) the name, ID and courses of student 1 (S1) and student 2 (S2),
b) the name of course 1 (C1) and the names of the students attending it. 
The names, IDs and courses are given: S1=Babis, ID: 1014
S2=Takis (transfer student), ID: 1514 (to be added later)
C1=Java, C2=Python, C3=Ruby
