Create a program that manages the registration of students (undergraduate [Students] and postgraduate [GraduateStudents]) in their courses. Specifically, the user should be able to:
1) insert students and the course they are enrolled in 
*Consider that the user enters only the numbers 1 and 2 (for undergraduate and postgraduate students respectively)
2) display the details of students and their courses
*The communication should not be done through the console but through a graphical interface. 
*Initially, the program will create the student S1, add his courses (C1, C2) and print his data and courses. Then it will create the postgraduate student GS1 and add his courses (C1, C2). Finally, the user will insert any number of students, the course they want to enroll in (this course can be only one) and print their data and course.
*The students' details are: i) undergraduate: name, ID 
							ii) postgraduate students: name, ID, supervisor
*Course details are: course: course name, credits
*A separate class should be created that creates the objects for students entered by the user. Therefore, this class will have as parameters the students entered by the user and their course
*S1: Babis, 11214
*C1: Java, 5
*C2: Math, 5
*GS1: Takis, 11010, Papadopoulos
