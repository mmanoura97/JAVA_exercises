Create a program called TimeStamp that schedules a meeting between the user's company and customers from different countries (therefore different time zones). This program receives a specific time T1 from the user, adds another hour, and then adds another hour. Eventually, the time will be displayed in the format HH:MM:SS. 
The program will be created in two versions:
Î±) The first version violates encapsulation and displays a message explaining why this is happening and what the result is.
b) The second version respects encapsulation and will display a message explaining what this means.
T1=23:15:40
